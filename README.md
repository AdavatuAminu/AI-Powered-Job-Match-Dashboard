# AI-Powered-Job-Match-Dashboard

# Description
A mini-project built for a frontend developer interview assignment to showcase technical depth, problem-solving skills, UI/UX understanding, and API handling. This dashboard displays job recommendations with AI-generated match scores, built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

# Features
Job Recommendations: Displays a list of jobs with titles, companies, locations, salaries, and AI-generated match scores.
Match Score Visualization: Progress bars indicate job fit (Green: 80%+, Yellow: 50-79%, Red: <50%).
Job Details Modal: Clicking a job opens a modal with detailed information and required skills.
Apply Functionality: "Apply Now" button with mock action; alerts users to missing skills with upskilling suggestions.
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly UI that adapts to various screen sizes.
AI Simulation: Match scores are generated server-side to mimic an AI process.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety throughout the codebase.
